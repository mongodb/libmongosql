# MongoDB MySQL Server Fork #

This is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)'s fork of the MySQL Server (v5.7) which we use in building the [MongoDB ODBC driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-odbc-driver).

This repository is published in order to share code and information and is *not intended to be used directly outside of MongoDB*. We provide no guarantees of bug fixes, ongoing maintenance, compatibility, or suitability for any user outside of MongoDB.
